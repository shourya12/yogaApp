# User Authentication:

Users can register and log in securely to access the yoga session booking system.
# Session Booking:

Upon logging in, users can select a month, year, and preferred batch for yoga sessions.

Users can make payments for their selected session securely.

For subsequent months, users can log in and access the yoga registration page to choose a different month, change batches if needed, and make payments for the upcoming sessions.
